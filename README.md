- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wil10w (Huw Williams)

- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Python developer. I don't have the knowledge to decide where I'm going after finishing the fundamentals, but I enjoy 
builidng GUIs in PyQT5 and TKinter. I am delving into selenium and webscraping, but it all seems really fun and interesting.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python Fundamentals through edX.orgs computing in Python. There are 4 certificates to complete the professions Certification. I'm on the 3rd.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well, I don't know what I can really help with.
